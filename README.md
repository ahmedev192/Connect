# 🌐 Connect – A Full-Stack Social Media Platform Built with ASP.NET Core & Clean Architecture

> *“Maybe you have to know the darkness before you can appreciate the light.”*

Connect is more than just a social media platform — it's a developer journey brought to life. From humble beginnings in classic MVC to a fully modular, real-time, cleanly architected system powered by .NET 9, **Connect** is a real-world showcase of learning, iteration, and full-stack engineering.

## 🚀 About the Project

When I started building Connect, I didn’t begin with perfect patterns or clean architecture. I began with **curiosity** — and a willingness to get it wrong before I could understand what “right” even meant.

This project began with ASP.NET Core MVC, then evolved:

* ➕ Service Layers to reduce controller bloat
* 🧩 Partial Views → View Components for modular UI
* 🧠 ViewModels & DTOs to clean up data flow
* 🔁 Repositories & Unit of Work for abstraction
* ⚡ SignalR for real-time interactivity
* 🛠️ Clean Architecture to bring structure
* 🧹 AutoMapper, Notification Dispatchers, and refactors to enforce SOLID principles
